Hi, I’m @brittany-russell. I recently graduated from BYU with a masters in statistics, as well as a BS in economics.
I'm interested in health and health economics applications of statistics, economic theory, and optimizing statistical models 
using the costs/benefits/constraints of the situation for which they're being used. For example, the costs of different classification errors 
can be used to choose an optimal cutoff for a classification model.

I’m currently learning MySQL, R Shiny, and Python to expand my data analysis toolkit and make sure that the end of my formal 
schooling doesn't mark the end of my education.

Contact me using ___ if you have a question or comment!
