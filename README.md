Hi, I’m @brittany-russell. I recently graduated from BYU with an MS in statistics and BS in economics.
I'm interested in health applications in statistics and economics, economic theory, and optimizing statistical models 
using the costs/benefits of the situation.

I’m working on personal statistical analysis and programming projects to form a portfolio that will be shared here.
