Hi, I’m @brittany-russell. I recently graduated from BYU with an MS in statistics and BS in economics.
I'm interested in health and health economics applications of statistics, economic theory, and optimizing statistical models 
using the costs/benefits/constraints of the situation for which they're being used. (For example, using the costs of different 
classification errors to choose the optimal cutoff for a classification model).

I’m currently learning MySQL, R Shiny, and Python to expand my data analysis toolkit and to make sure that the end of my formal 
schooling doesn't mark the end of my education.
